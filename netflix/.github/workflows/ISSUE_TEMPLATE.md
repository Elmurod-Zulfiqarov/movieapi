Please describe how you installed Flake8

Example:

$ pip install --user flake8  
$ brew install flake8
# etc.
Note: Some *nix distributions patch Flake8 arbitrarily to accommodate incompatible software versions. If you're on one of those distributions, your issue may be closed and you will be asked to open an issue with your distribution package maintainers instead.

Please provide the exact, unmodified output of flake8 --bug-report

Please describe the problem or feature

If this is a bug report, please explain with examples (and example code) what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
